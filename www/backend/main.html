## Specification

### Web Architecture
Passing static page from the server to the browser we ensure them to be rendered by the same browser. Our application is composed by a database (postgres), 
a server (in Node.js) and a folder containing the static page.
In other to make them work together and communicate with the right path we use OpenAPI and swagger. 
From the swagger editor we download the server part. 
It was created without the DataLayer, that we add it later using Knex and setting the path to the database of Heroku, we make it pass the database to each of the 
service we needed to be in the database in these case Member(people), Event, Service, Kennel, Pet.

### API

#### REST compliance
We try to follow as mush as possible the REST paradigm, for the naming convention we did more the one time all the code to respect as much as possible an order.
We did have a client-server communication with only the essential get with exception of member because some limitation with knex. 
The client have the access only the information inside the database. Every time you click in a page a new request is made there is no data storage in the client part. 
The server create the connection to the database and manage the path request with OpenAPI.
For our site we needed only the GET operation.

#### OpenAPI Resource models
Describe here synthetically, which models you have introduced for
resources.
### Data model
Describe with an ER diagram the model used in the data layer of your web
application. How these map to the OpenAPI data model?
## Implementation
### Tools used
Firstly we use Swagger on the site <a href= 'https://editor.swagger.io'>https://editor.swagger.io</a> and we create a json file with all the path 
we downloaded with the provided server creator form the site. The module connect in order to establish connection, serve-static to serve the html, 
knex for the connection to the database and handle the request to it, postgres as database, git and finally Heroku

### Discussion
Describe here:
- How did you make sure your web application adheres to the provided
OpenAPI specification? Which method did you use to test all APIs
endpoints against the expected response?
- Why do you think your web application adheres to common practices to
partition a REST-based web application (static assets vs.
application data)
- We basically have just GET
- we use relation between tables with the FK and in order to send data we did a join between the linked tables

## Other information

### Task assignment
-Erbol work on front end (90%) 
-Lucia work on front end (90%)
-Luca work on back end (90%)
Step by step the implementation of each part as been explained and shared among group member in other to understand and possibly interchange task in other to complete the project and help the part that is been implemented slowly.

### Analysis of existing API
We start from doing the free courses from <a href = 'https://www.codecademy.com'>https://www.codecademy.com</a> where we learn by doing how to use html/css/js 
obviously with the support of <a href ='https://www.html.it'>https://www.html.it</a>.
In order to understand API we took full information from <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZvSYJDk-us'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZvSYJDk-us</a> 
from here we go to <a href = 'https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn'>https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn</a>
where step by step is explained what an API is and how to implement one, there are also some explanation on how to do the back end part and the front end of a site. 
The main learning for using Swagger was from the example Pet of the editor swagger and the documentation inside. 
In order to understand how to use and what is node js we did <a href ='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-7RQ46RgxU&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gcy9lrvMJ75z9maRw4byYp'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-7RQ46RgxU&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gcy9lrvMJ75z9maRw4byYp</a> where he explain step by step the fundamental passage to create a small app, 
unfortunately using express so our learning had to go back to the module connect difficult to understand due to the lack of site that explain it we found some video 
that give us some idea but the main research was done in <a href='https://nodejs.org/it'>https://nodejs.org/it/</a>. For creating a database we had to do a full tutorial 
from <a href = 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qw--VYLpxG4'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qw--VYLpxG4</a> this video base all our creation for the database and help us to understand 
clearly the join between table used to pass the information in json, these information has been used in the implementation of the back end. 
Needles to say that to solve our problem we constantly used <a href = 'https://stackoverflow.com'>https://stackoverflow.com</a> and <a href = 'https://github.com'>https://github.com</a>

### Learning outcome
Basically all the member learned everything. 
None of us done something related to the topic that has been discussed int these exam. 
Erbol done some Cyber Security study, Luca and Erbol had some small experience in Html because of the exam: Computer Graphics that explain the effect 
that can be applied to some created figure in html but not how to create a page html.
