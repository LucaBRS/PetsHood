'In 1996 the Canile Intercomunale moved from the old structure of S.Cataldo, managed by ENPA, to the new equipped aera of the Municipality in via Nonantolana 1219. Its management is entrusted to the voluntary association CSA â€“ Centro Soccorso Animali ( Animal Rescue Centre) with an agreement that, lasted 13 year.
Following the start of works for the construction of the TAV, in August 2004, this area was moved to another. This new area has been organized with large green spaced that can be used for activities with the animals housed. Structurally the kennel is divided into stables that house a variable number of boxes, depending on the size of the stricture.',

'We operate in the territory of Reggio Emilia, always pursuing the welfare of the animals we keep with the priority of finding their family, with pre and post-foster care checks. We are proud of the remarkable results achieved over the years, especially the high number of foster care, which, however, is opposed to a relentless flow of new entries. In recent years, we have also seen a considerable increase in the number of frightened dogs, which are not very socialized and therefore not reliable.
Thanks to the incessant work of our volunteers, assisted by our dog educators, we have been able to recover dogs intimidated and distrustful of humans, we have socialized them, accustomed to the collar, to walks on a leash, and in the end some of them have rewarded us with the most beautiful gift: a new family!',
